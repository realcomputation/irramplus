Seokbin's GURP with Donghyun (and Sewon), continued from his Individual Study project:
1. specify the Abstract Data Type (ADT) of Grassmannian/Quantum Logic over R^d 
   with operations  i) intersection, ii) Minkowski sum, iii) orthogonal complement, iv) projection
2. design algorithms for the above ADT in case d=3: homogeneous lines and planes
3. implement (2) in iRRAM
4. design algorithms for the above ADT in case of arbitrary d
5. implement (4) in iRRAM
